# GUI_project_in_CPP
here is some project which I made in C++ (GUI)
if you need the ".exe" file then just use the Projet1.exe file

if the source code needed the clone the repository and open it using "C++Builder IDE"

//must remember 

without "Embarcadero C++ Builder IDE" you can't use the source code.
//vscode is useless in this case so use Embarcadero C++ Builder.
